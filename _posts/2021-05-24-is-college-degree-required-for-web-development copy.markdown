 When it comes to doing web development jobs, we are now in the era of doing work remotely. During this Covid-19 pandemic, more and more companies and clients shift their tasks and work on remote workers from anywhere around the world. With this era of remote work, do clients require a college degree?

 I believe that it depends on the type of clients. Mostly those corporate companies, startups or local companies tend to require the developer to have a college degree. The reason is that these companies usually hire fresh graduates and have them undergo an internship or training. So it's important that the candidates are well equipped and knowledgeable on the basic foundation of the technical side of development.

 On the other side, those clients like small businesseses usually look for candidates based on their skillset and portfolio. As long as the candidate can show decent projects they did, they will decide based on that and will not look if the candidate has completed his degree or not.

 There is even a [news](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-hire-jobs-without-degree-experts-say-college-important-2020-10){:target="_blank"} recently that even google and apple does not require a degree to pass their applicant's screening process. Instead they will base their screening on Google and Apple certificates being passed by the applicants.

 On client's point of view whether corporate, startup or small businesses, still the ultimate goal is to find a candidate that can be compatible with their workflow and process and can deliver the tasks at hand whether or not the applicant has a college degree or not.
