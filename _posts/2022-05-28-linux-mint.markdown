 In my first job as a full time web developer, my company decided to use linux Mint as the Operating System instead of Windows. I guess the reason in using linux instead of windows is to save cost buying Windows license.

 Eversince then I became really hooked in using linux to do web development.

 Some of the things that are positive in using linux:
- it's free
- fast loading even with low pc specs
- open source programs and completely free
- customizable
- community driven support
- very secure

Disadvantages of using linux
- use of terminal which can be very hard for first time users
- steep learning curve
- difficulty in doing troubleshooting
- some hardware drivers are not supported

For first time users of Linux, I recommend to use Linux Mint as this is closer to Windows in terms of gui.
